    <b>Chickens</b>, domesticated descendants of junglefowl, are common poultry raised globally for meat, eggs, and feathers, known for their social flocks, distinct "pecking order," and varied breeds, from egg-layers to meat birds. 
    <p>These omnivores forage for seeds and insects, communicate with over 30 sounds, and exhibit surprising intelligence, including recognizing faces and dreaming, while hens provide versatile, nutrient-rich eggs, making them vital farm animals.</p>
    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl native to Southeast Asia, is one of the most widespread and numerous domestic animals on Earth, with a global population exceeding 26.5 billion as of 2023. 
    Domesticated approximately 8,000 years ago, these birds are primarily kept for their eggs and meat, with over 50 billion produced annually for consumption. 
    Chickens are highly social, intelligent, and gregarious creatures that live in flocks with complex social structures known as "pecking orders," which dictate access to food and nesting sites. 
    They are capable of communicating through more than 30 distinct vocalizations, ranging from the loud, territorial crow of the rooster to the clucking of a hen communicating with her chicks. 
    As omnivores, chickens naturally scratch the soil to forage for seeds, insects, and small animals. 
    While specialized breeds such as broilers (for meat) and layers (for eggs) have been developed for commercial production, with some hens producing over 300 eggs per year, many people also keep them as backyard pets due to their distinct personalities and ability to recognize human faces. 
    They have a varied lifespan, typically living 5 – 10 years, though commercial production often cuts this lifespan significantly.
     Furthermore, chickens are fascinating in their biology, with studies showing they can dream, possess color vision better than humans (including ultraviolet light), and share a direct ancestry with the Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>
